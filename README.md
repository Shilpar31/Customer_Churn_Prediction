# Customer_Churn_Prediction using PyTorch
## Overview
This project predicts customer churn using a neural network built with PyTorch. 
The goal is to identify customers likely to discontinue services using the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

## Dataset
- Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)
- Contains customer demographics, services, billing information, and churn label

## Steps Performed
1. Data cleaning and handling missing values
2. Encoding categorical variables
3. Feature scaling using StandardScaler
4. Train-validation split
5. Building a neural network using PyTorch
6. Handling class imbalance
7. Model training and evaluation using ROC-AUC

## Model Performance
- Validation ROC-AUC: **0.84**

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- PyTorch
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab - colab file attached
2. Upload the dataset - Telco dataset attached, or you can find it in kaggle
3. Run all cells sequentially
